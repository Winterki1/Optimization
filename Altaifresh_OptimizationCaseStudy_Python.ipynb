    "Imagine you are the chief executive in charge of the Agricultural Economics branch of Altaifresh, China, and it is your team’s responsibility to conduct an annual analysis of various factors involved in crop production—such as cost, waste management, crop demand, etc. and to advise the Agriculture Operations team on which seedlings to purchase and cultivate this year. The objective is to minimise company costs while remaining compliant with emissions and waste guidelines and meeting projected land use and production requirements when the plants begin bearing fruit."

You also have a large corps of maintenance workers tasked with watering, fertilising and harvesting the crops and they provide, collectively, up to 42,500 hours of maintenance per week. You have 1,645,300 square meters of land at your disposal for planting, and a weekly, refrigerated storage capacity of 645,200 kg of fruits or vegetables (to house harvested crops before they are shipped to grocery stores). Based on projected demand, at least 55 per cent of the plants you purchase and cultivate must be fruits. Finally, you are subject to two environmental impact guidelines: your crops must be, on average, at or below an emissions risk index score of 80 (50-100 scale), and your average projected waste (the percentage of the crops you cultivate that go bad before they can be sold) must be at or below 18 per cent."
